# Project Description
This project was designed to help anyone learn the streets in their community in a fun, interactive way. With how developed GPS navigation applications have become, many don't know the streets surrounding their own home. Challenge your navigation skills, and learn along the way! Personally, this app is how I learned to navigate in my community when I first obtained my driver's license.


*Note: Although this project asks for the user's home address, it is not stored and is completely kept private to the user.*
